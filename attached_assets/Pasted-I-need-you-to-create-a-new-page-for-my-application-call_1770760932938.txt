I need you to create a new page for my application called "Updates & Announcements". This page will serve as the official news feed for TWH OSINT.

Please perform the following tasks:

Create a New Page (client/src/pages/Updates.tsx):

Build a new React component that displays system updates.

Design: Use the existing Cyber/Hacker/Matrix aesthetic (green text, black background, terminal style borders) so it fits perfectly with the rest of the site. Use components like Card or custom div containers with borders.

Content Requirements (Must include these sections):

✅ API Status: Announce that the Mobile Number Search API is fully fixed. Explain that we had to delete the old History Database to fix a bug where "Error/No Data" responses were getting cached/stuck. This reset ensures everyone now gets fresh, accurate data.

💰 Credit System Changes:

New Signup Bonus is now 5 Credits (previously 10).

Mobile Search Cost: Increasing from 1 Credit to 2 Credits starting February 13th.

Other Services: IP and Vehicle search costs remain the same for now. Any future changes will be announced here in advance.

Aadhar Search: Currently CLOSED/Offline because TWH does not have the funds to run it right now.

🛡️ Security & Free Access: Warn that fake accounts will be BANNED. Remind users they can use the "Redeem Code" system to get free credits if they cannot pay.

💡 Transparency (The Cost): Explain clearly: "Every single search costs TWH ₹2.5! Plus we pay for hosting, API servers, and maintenance. Paid credits keep this tool alive, but free options are available for genuine users."

🤝 Business & Services: Add a note at the bottom: "Want to build a website like this or purchase APIs? Contact us on Telegram: @Twhosint"

Navigation:

Do NOT add any action buttons (like "Buy" or "Login") on this page; just display the text information clearly.

Add a small, simple link titled "Updates & News" to the Footer of the website (or bottom of the Navbar/Sidebar) so users can access this page.

Routing:

Register the new route /updates in client/src/App.tsx.

Please generate the code for the new page and the updates to the routing and navigation.
